      I am a graduated at International University, major in Biochemistry.
      However, I've always interested in technology and have transition myself
      to software career path in 2019. My main method of study is self-taught,
      as I spend months teaching myself core concepts of computer science and
      data analytics. You can find my journey as a developer from the timeline
